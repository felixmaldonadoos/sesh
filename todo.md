# high-level 

1. add character choice/accounts
  - each unique player should be able to have their unique character (in the beginning, theyll be premade characters, but unique users. little by little).
2. show active player list (like middle button in PS5 to show current lobby w/ points, fouls, rebounds, etc.)
3. have a session/lobby list of active players
